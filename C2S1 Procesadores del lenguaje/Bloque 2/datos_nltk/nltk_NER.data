Colia (GPE)
tookw the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya (ORGANIZATION)
, not far off . In one of the side rooms there sat at a table—looking like one of the regular guests of the establishment Ardalion Alexandrovitch (ORGANIZATION)
, with a bottle before him , and a newspaper on his knee . He was waiting for the prince , and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long harangue about something or other ; but so far gone was he that the prince could hardly understand a word .

But why recall all this ? There was insanity on both sides . For him , the prince , to love this woman with passion , was unthinkable . It would be cruel and inhuman . Yes . Rogojin (PERSON)
is not fair to himself ; he has a large heart ; he has aptitude for sympathy . When he learns the truth , and finds what a pitiable being is this injured , broken , half-insane creature , he will forgive her all the torment she has caused him . He will become her slave , her brother , her friend . Compassion (ORGANIZATION)
will teach even Rogojin (PERSON)
, it will show him how to reason . Compassion (ORGANIZATION)
is the chief law of human existence . Oh , how guilty he felt towards Rogojin (PERSON)
! And , for a few warm , hasty words spoken in Moscow (GPE)
, Parfen (PERSON)
had called him “ brother , ” while he—but no , this was delirium ! It would all come right ! That gloomy Parfen (PERSON)
had implied that his faith was waning ; he must suffer dreadfully . He said he liked to look at that picture ; it was not that he liked it , but he felt the need of looking at it . Rogojin (PERSON)
was not merely a passionate soul ; he was a fighter . He was fighting for the restoration of his dying faith . He must have something to hold on to and believe , and someone to believe in . What a strange picture that of Holbein (PERSON)
’ s is ! Why , this is the street , and here ’ s the house , No (GPE)
. 16 .

The prince pulled a letter out of his pocket . “ Is he raving ? ” said the general . “ Are we really in a mad-house ? ” There was silence for a moment . Then Ptitsin (PERSON)
spoke .

“ Bravo (PERSON)
! ” said Ferdishenko (PERSON)
. Ptitsin (PERSON)
laughed too , though he had been very sorry to see the general appear . Even Colia (PERSON)
laughed and said , “ Bravo ! ” “ And I was right , truly right , ” cried the general , with warmth and solemnity , “ for if cigars are forbidden in railway carriages , poodles are much more so. ” “ Well , and what did the lady do ? ” asked Nastasia (GPE)
, impatiently . “ She—ah , that ’ s where all the mischief of it lies ! ” replied Ivolgin (PERSON)
, frowning . “ Without a word , as it were , of warning , she slapped me on the cheek ! An extraordinary woman ! ”
